    "## 1. Introduction to Decision Tree algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A Decision Tree algorithm is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms. It uses a tree like structure and their possible combinations to solve a particular problem. It belongs to the class of supervised learning algorithms where it can be used for both classification and regression purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree is a structure that includes a root node, branches, and leaf nodes. Each internal node denotes a test on an attribute, each branch denotes the outcome of a test, and each leaf node holds a class label. The topmost node in the tree is the root node. \n"

    "Classification and Regression Trees or **CART** is a term introduced by Leo Breiman to refer to Decision Tree algorithms that can be used for classification and regression modeling problems.The CART algorithm provides a foundation for other important algorithms like bagged decision trees, random forest and boosted decision trees.\n",

    "The Decision-Tree algorithm is one of the most frequently and widely used supervised machine learning algorithms that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. The intuition behind the Decision-Tree algorithm is very simple to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Decision Tree algorithm intuition is as follows:-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tFor each attribute in the dataset, the Decision-Tree algorithm forms a node. The most important attribute is placed at the root node. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tFor evaluating the task in hand, we start at the root node and we work our way down the tree by following the corresponding node that meets our condition or decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tThis process continues until a leaf node is reached. It contains the prediction or the outcome of the Decision Tree.\n"

    "## 4. Attribute selection measures\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary challenge in the Decision Tree implementation is to identify the attributes which we consider as the root node and each level. This process is known as the **attributes selection**. There are different attributes selection measure to identify the attribute which can be considered as the root node at each level.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 popular attribute selection measures. They are as follows:-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Information gain**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gini index**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While using **Information gain** as a criterion, we assume attributes to be categorical and for **Gini index** attributes are assumed to be continuous. These attribute selection measures are described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Information gain\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By using information gain as a criterion, we try to estimate the information contained by each attribute. To understand the concept of Information Gain, we need to know another concept called **Entropy**. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Entropy measures the impurity in the given dataset. In Physics and Mathematics, entropy is referred to as the randomness or uncertainty of a random variable X. In information theory, it refers to the impurity in a group of examples. **Information gain** is the decrease in entropy. Information gain computes the difference between entropy before split and average entropy after split of the dataset based on given attribute values. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser) Decision Tree algorithm uses entropy to calculate information gain. So, by calculating decrease in **entropy measure** of each attribute we can calculate their information gain. The attribute with the highest information gain is chosen as the splitting attribute at the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gini index\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Another attribute selection measure that **CART (Categorical and Regression Trees)** uses is the **Gini index**. It uses the Gini method to create split points. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gini index says, if we randomly select two items from a population, they must be of the same class and probability for this is 1 if the population is pure.\n",
    "\n",
    "It works with the categorical target variable “Success” or “Failure”. It performs only binary splits. The higher the value of Gini, higher the homogeneity. CART (Classification and Regression Tree) uses the Gini method to create binary splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps to Calculate Gini for a split\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tCalculate Gini for sub-nodes, using formula sum of the square of probability for success and failure (p^2+q^2).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tCalculate Gini for split using weighted Gini score of each node of that split.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of a discrete-valued attribute, the subset that gives the minimum gini index for that chosen is selected as a splitting attribute. In the case of continuous-valued attributes, the strategy is to select each pair of adjacent values as a possible split-point and point with smaller gini index chosen as the splitting point. The attribute with minimum Gini index is chosen as the splitting attribute.\n"
